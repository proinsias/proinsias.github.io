I want to create an introductory log post to the topic of applying stoicism in my life. Have an introductory paragraph that discusses how I came to stoicism. I find its principles are common in many other philosophies of life, but what appeals to me is their abstraction away from any religious background. I find it freeing to identify how to live according to Saint Francis prayer of identifying what I can control what I cannot, and having the courage to change what I can the patience to deal with what I cannot on the wisdom to know the difference then I should list the various ways in which I will discuss applying this in my blog, such as at work as an individual contributor at work as a manager in my personal life, and to motivate how I deal with the politically divisive climate that I find myself in at this time. Include links to the books and maybe podcast that I have found useful as an introduction to stoicism, but mention that I will not be going into the details of the philosophy in any great detail, except for some reference references to the principles as I incorporate them into the post.
