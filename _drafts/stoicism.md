Prompt for image.

Professional minimalist hand-drawn banner illustration for a Stoicism blog post.
Clean white background.
Two large overlapping hand-drawn circles like a Venn diagram, drawn with black ink marker lines.

Left circle text: "Things That Matter"
Right circle text: "Things You Can Control"

The overlapping center area is subtly shaded and emphasized as the focal point.

Below the circles, handwritten text reads:
"What You Should Focus On"
with a simple underline.

Neat, intentional handwritten typography, balanced spacing, calm Stoic aesthetic.
High readability, refined sketch style, editorial quality, not cartoonish.

Aspect ratio: wide blog banner.

Given my first name,
it's probably not surprising that I am familiar with the Serenity Prayer:

> Grant me the strength to accept the things I cannot change,
> the courage to change the things I can,
> and the wisdom to know the difference.
> 
> ― <cite>Saint Francis of Assisi</cite>.

I’ve always appreciated the sentiment of this prayer,
but I struggled to find practical ways to apply it during stressful times.
Nevertheless, I have found different sources of wisdom
that echo this message and do provide the guidance I desire.

The first was at the start of my
[graduate studies in astrophysics](portfolio/tres.html),
when I became a pracitioner of
[David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)
methodology,
which emphasizes clarity of mind and effective action
through *focusing* on what is actionable.

> Suffice it to say that something automatic
> and extraordinary happens in your mind
> when you create and *focus* \[emphasis mine\]
> on a clear picture of what you want.
>
> ― <cite>David Allen</cite>, Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity.

More recently, I came across [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/)'s 
accessible writings on applying the timeless principles of
[Stoicism](https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism/)
to modern life.
What drew me to Stoicism was its emphasis on *focusing* on what we can control 
and accepting what we cannot,
echoing the wisdom found in the Serenity prayer. 

I decide to explore the application of this philosophy
to various aspects of my life,
and to share my experiences in this blog.
My plan is to discuss its use in such domains as:

- Working as an individual contributor.
- Managing others at work.
- My personal life.
- Navigating the politically divisive climate of today.

My hope is that this plan will help me
to internalize the lessons I have come across so far,
and to share them with others who may find them useful.

In my next post, I’ll share how Stoicism has guided me
as an individual contributor and Data Scientist.

While the blog introduces Stoicism, it provides limited depth on *how* Stoicism has informed your thoughts or actions. Moving beyond theoretical introductions to concrete, specific examples would deepen the reader's engagement. For instance:
     - Share a specific work or personal challenge in which Stoicism helped you "accept the unavoidable" or "focus on the controllable."
     - Tie the "Things You Can Control" principle more explicitly to practical actions or outcomes from your life.
   - Consider referencing key Stoic texts or philosophers (e.g., Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus) to give richer historical and philosophical grounding.

The bullet list at the end is promising but lacks detail. Provide at least one practical insight or lesson from each listed domain (e.g., "Stoicism taught me to navigate the divisive political climate by..."

Add quote from Ryan Holiday on acceptance and control to reinforce the Stoic theme.

Potential readers often ask, "What’s in this for me?" Make the value of adopting Stoic principles clearer:
     - How has this philosophy tangibly improved your well-being, career satisfaction, or relationships?
     - Why should someone invest time in exploring Stoicism?
