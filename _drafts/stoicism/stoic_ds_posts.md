### Preferred Indifferents: Ambition Without Attachment

there are things that, all being equal, it would make sense to prefer over others. Health and physical well-being over illness, for instance. They call those things that usually benefit us preferred indifferents and things that are often detrimental to people dispreferred indifferents.

Your opinions, thoughts, and actions are yours to choose, and no one and nothing can influence them without your consent. This will change your relationship to indifferents; you’ll find that their value isn’t found within them but is based in how you choose to use them.
