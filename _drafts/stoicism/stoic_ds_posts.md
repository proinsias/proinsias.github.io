“Focus on the things you can control so your actions are impactful, and \[don't be\] wasting your time on that which you can’t change.”

“It may seem paradoxical, but Stoic acceptance actually gives you the strength to overcome challenges. Passivity arises more often from fear than from acceptance. When a rude person makes aggressive demands, how often do you just give in, worrying that standing up for yourself would make matters worse? The Stoic accepts that the person in front of them is being hostile, but they can choose how to respond. If the belligerent person’s demands are unjust, the Stoic works for justice.”

“I begin my day with a Stoic meditation that reminds me I am capable of facing any obstacle I meet. I have mental tools like the Dichotomy of Control, which helps me focus on those things I have the ability to change. Stoicism has given me the Festival Mind-set, in which every crowd becomes a party and which helps me enjoy what others may find frustrating. At night, I do an Evening Review, which allows me to openly evaluate myself and leads me to improve myself day by day. Soon, you will have these same tools and much more. With practice, you’ll gain the flourishing life that Stoicism promises.”

“In fact, Stoicism claims that all wrong actions stem from ignorance of a better way.”

“The philosophy asserts that virtue ... is happiness, and it is our perceptions of things ... that cause most of our trouble.”
