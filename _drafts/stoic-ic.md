* during some recent career turbulence, stocisim has provided me with a framework for continuous growth.
* I applied stoicism to the effect of having no job for multiple months and how I needed to consider it as not an obstacle to overcome but they are using it as the way where I could teach myself new skills and use it as a time to reflect on what I really wanted to do

* Application of stoic concepts:
    * focusing on what is and is not within our control.
    * events don't disturb us, but our judgements about them do.
    * preferred indifferents (success, money, titles): ambition without attachment.
    * wisdom over reputation.
    * long-term thinking
    * indiffierence to external validation.
    * virtue is the only true good.
* data science as a profession of uncertainty, delayed feedback, and external dependency.
    * working in a field where you're often wrong, and where success is often out of your hands.
* effort
    * "errors are a sign not a failure but of effort" from the book make it stick
* other's judgement
* preparation vs promotion
* recognition
* how to develop your career despite obstacles beyond your control.
* managing frustration in matrixed organizations.
* reframing performance reviews.
* letting go of outcome obsession.
* career progression without anxiety.
* detaching self-worth from job title or impact
* avoiding burnout driven by identify fusion
* goal settings without ego
* evaluating opportunities rationally
* knowing when to walk away.
* judgements
    * misinterpreting ambiguity as threat
    * emotional reactions versus reasoned responses
    * cognitive distancing
    * writing before reacting
* emotional resilience to failed experiments
* separating ego from model performance
* normalize being wrong
* wisdom over reputation
    * being the smartest person in the room
    * bikesheding
    * letting go of being right to be useful
    * trade cleverness for clarity
    * knowing when to defer
* long-term thinking
    * patience in a world of slow feedback loops
    * delayed model impact
    * slow experimentation cycles
    * organizational latency
    * focus on process quality
    * maintain motivation without immedicate reward
    * tracking leacing indicators
* indifference to external validation
    * recommendations ignored
    * work misunderstood or oversimplified
    * measuring success by craftmanship
* virtue is the only good
    * questionable metrics
    * shady modeling practices
    * pressure to manipulate results
    * ethical models
    * public pre-commitment to explicit standards
    * calm refusal techniques with examples of need for trustworthiness
    * long-term reputation management

Professional minimalist hand-drawn banner illustration for a Stoicism blog post.
Clean white background.
Two large overlapping hand-drawn circles like a Venn diagram, drawn with black ink marker lines.

Left circle text: "Things That Matter"
Right circle text: "Things You Can Control"

The overlapping center area is subtly shaded and emphasized as the focal point.

Below the circles, handwritten text reads:
"What You Should Focus On"
with a simple underline.

Neat, intentional handwritten typography, balanced spacing, calm Stoic aesthetic.
High readability, refined sketch style, editorial quality, not cartoonish.

Aspect ratio: wide blog banner.
