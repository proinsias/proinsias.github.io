As I mentioned in my introductory post to
[Stoicism and the pursuit of a good life](https://proinsias.github.io/stoicism/stoicism-and-the-pursuit-of-a-good-life/),
Stoic principles provide an essential toolkit with which to endure the struggles of modern knowledge work.
No matter how diligent or competent you are as an individual contributor,
you cannot guarante a significant impact at your company.
And you must also weather macroeconomic shifts and technology cycles
in a job market shaped by layoffs and AI automation.

This lack of control is especially apparent in the domain of Data Science.
For example, practioners are rarely in full control of the data they require for their models.
They typically have much higher quality standards than other data consumers within their company.
And so they can face trying to make a silk purse out of a pig's ear.
Even when a data scientist is able to craft a useful insight from noisy data,
they cannot mandate the adoption of data-driven decisions,
given shifting business priorities and organizational politics.

So what is a Data Scientist to do? How can we thrive in a field defined by uncertainty?
Applying the Stoic philoscopy of the dichotomy of control provides a practical strategy
for sustaining focus, integrity, and long-term effectiveness.
We first accept that we cannot control these things.
Instead, we re-anchor our professional identity to focus on those things we can control:

-   The quality of our work (rigorous analysis, reproducible code, clear communication, etc.),
-   Our professional integrity, and
-   How we **prepare for** and **react** to the things we cannot control.

during some recent career turbulence, it has provided me with a framework for continuous growth. Practice virtue - explain concept of virtue.

indifference to external validation.

“Focus on the things you can control so your actions are impactful, and \[don't be\] wasting your time on that which you can’t change.”

“It may seem paradoxical, but Stoic acceptance actually gives you the strength to overcome challenges. Passivity arises more often from fear than from acceptance. When a rude person makes aggressive demands, how often do you just give in, worrying that standing up for yourself would make matters worse? The Stoic accepts that the person in front of them is being hostile, but they can choose how to respond. If the belligerent person’s demands are unjust, the Stoic works for justice.”

“I begin my day with a Stoic meditation that reminds me I am capable of facing any obstacle I meet. I have mental tools like the Dichotomy of Control, which helps me focus on those things I have the ability to change. Stoicism has given me the Festival Mind-set, in which every crowd becomes a party and which helps me enjoy what others may find frustrating. At night, I do an Evening Review, which allows me to openly evaluate myself and leads me to improve myself day by day. Soon, you will have these same tools and much more. With practice, you’ll gain the flourishing life that Stoicism promises.”

-   during some recent career turbulence, stocisim has provided me with a framework for continuous growth.
-   I applied stoicism to the effect of having no job for multiple months and how I needed to consider it as not an obstacle to overcome but they are using it as the way where I could teach myself new skills and use it as a time to reflect on what I really wanted to do

-   Application of stoic concepts:
    -   focusing on what is and is not within our control.
    -   events don't disturb us, but our judgements about them do.
    -   preferred indifferents (success, money, titles): ambition without attachment.
    -   wisdom over reputation.
    -   long-term thinking
    -   indiffierence to external validation.
    -   virtue is the only true good.
-   data science as a profession of uncertainty, delayed feedback, and external dependency.
    -   working in a field where you're often wrong, and where success is often out of your hands.
-   effort
    -   "errors are a sign not a failure but of effort" from the book make it stick
-   other's judgement
-   preparation vs promotion
-   recognition
-   how to develop your career despite obstacles beyond your control.

-   separating ego from model performance
-   normalize being wrong

    -   being the smartest person in the room
    -   bikesheding
    -   letting go of being right to be useful
    -   trade cleverness for clarity
    -   knowing when to defer
-   long-term thinking
    -   patience in a world of slow feedback loops
    -   delayed model impact
    -   slow experimentation cycles
    -   organizational latency
    -   focus on process quality

# Prompt for header image

Create an image of a Data Scientist to the left of a shield (in the middle of the image)
with the words "Indifference to external validation".
Add three arrows coming from the right towards the data scientist
with labels "Organizational politics", "Data drift", and "Ill-defined priorities".
Add three arrows going away from the shield with no labels.
The data scientist should be sifting through dirty water labeled "Noisy Data"
to find gems labeled "Business insights" and "Actionable predictions".

The output format of the image should be a wide image designed to be the banner for a blog post.

Double check that the labels are exactly as specified.
