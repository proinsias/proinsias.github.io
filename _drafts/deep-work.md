FIXME: Add image of book cover somewhere.

Discuss how I didn't have problems being productive and advancing my career studying for hours as a student.
at graduate level i started to get distracted by all the shallow work that presented itself, did less of the deep work.
now as a manager I struggle with this even more, which is why I have found this book really inspiring and helpful.

Cal Newport.

who he is, what led him to discover this.

> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration
> that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.
> These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
>
> Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted.
> These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
>
> Deep Work Is Valuable
>
> The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare
> at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.
> As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
>
> I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work,
> with the shallow activities I absolutely cannot avoid batched into smaller bursts at the peripheries of my schedule.
> Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration,
> it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.
>
> to cultivate an ability to produce real value in an increasingly distracted world;
> and to recognize a truth embraced by the most productive and important personalities of generations past:
> A deep life is a good life.
>
> The consumer will choose the very best. Even if the talent advantage of the best is small
> compared to the next rung down on the skill ladder, the superstars still win the bulk of the market.

Not sure I agree with this. 10x developer myth. $300 wine bottle v $30. ROI.

Ben B's point -> not enough credit for our agencies

APPLY THIS TO LEISURE TIME TOO! MAXIMIZE HUMAN POTENTIAL!!!

> Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy
>
> 1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
> 2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
>
> The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.
>
> Deep Work Is Rare
>
> big trends in business today actively decrease people's ability to perform deep work,
>
> The Principle of Least Resistance:
> In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line,
> we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.
>
> If you work in an environment where you can get an answer to a question
> or a specific piece of information immediately when the need arises,
> this makes your life easier—at least, in the moment.
> If you couldn't count on this quick response time you'd instead have to do more advance planning for your work,
> be more organized, and be prepared to put things aside for a while
> and turn your attention elsewhere while waiting for what you requested.
> All of this would make the day to day of your working life harder
> (even if it produced more satisfaction and a better outcome in the long term).
>
> Instead of trying to manage their time and obligations themselves,
> they let the impending meeting each week force them to take some action on a given project
> and more generally provide a highly visible simulacrum of progress.
>
> A similar reality creates problems for many knowledge workers.
> They want to prove that they're productive members of the team and are earning their keep,
> but they're not entirely clear what this goal constitutes.
>
> Busyness as Proxy for Productivity:
> In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs,
> many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity:
> doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.
>
> Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values
> like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and non-technological.
> Even worse, to support deep work often requires the rejection of much of what is new and high-tech.
>
> Deep Work Is Meaningful
>
> A Neurological Argument for Depth
>
> By skillfully managing their attention, they improved their world without changing anything concrete about it.
>
> Many knowledge workers spend most of their working day interacting with these types of shallow concerns.
> Even when they're required to complete something more involved,
> the habit of frequently checking inboxes ensures that these issues remain at the forefront of their attention.
> Gallagher teaches us that this is a foolhardy way to go about your day,
> as it ensures that your mind will construct an understanding of your working life that's dominated
> by stress, irritation, frustration, and triviality.
> The world represented by your inbox, in other words, isn't a pleasant world to inhabit.
>
> A Psychological Argument for Depth
>
> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time,
> because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges,
> all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it.
> Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped
> into something that can be enjoyed.
>
> A Philosophical Argument for Depth
>
> In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify what's meaningful and what's not,
> an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism.
>
> Put another way, a wooden wheel is not noble, but its shaping can be. The same applies to knowledge work.
> You don't need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work.
>
> Deep work, therefore, is key to extracting meaning from your profession in the manner described by Dreyfus and Kelly.
>
> Rule #1 Work Deeply
>
> The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions
> and add routines and rituals to your working life
> designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into
> and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

Link to Atomic Habits, the book I started after Deep Work. Idea that processes are more important than goals.

List of different philosophies to deep work. which one I picked.

> call the bimodal philosophy of deep work.
> This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches
> to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else.
>
> I face each week as it arrives and do my best to squeeze out as much depth as possible.
>
> By reducing the need to make decisions about deep work moment by moment,
> I can preserve more mental energy for the deep thinking itself.
>
> \[Great creative minds\] think like artists but work like accountants."
>
> Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations.

The 4 Disciplines of Execution

> Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important
>
> "The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish."
> They elaborate that execution should be aimed at a small number of "wildly important goals."
>
> "If you want to win the war for attention, don't try to say 'no' to the trivial distractions
> you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say 'yes' to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing,
> and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else."
>
> Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures
>
> lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.
>
> Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
>
> Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability
> The 4DX authors elaborate that the final step to help maintain a focus on lead measures is
> to put in place "a rhythm of regular and frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal."
>
> recommend the habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead
>
> The 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more difficult than strategizing.
>
> At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues
> until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations,
> and no scheming about how you'll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely.
>
> Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights
>
> Reason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply
>
> spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate.
>
> Only the confidence that you're done with work until the next day can convince your brain
> to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow.
>
> Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important
>
> you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention.
>
> Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is
> to support your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual
> that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed.
> In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed
> and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion,
> or (2) it's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right.
>
> When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done.
>
> Rule #2 Embrace Boredom
>
> Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind
> from a dependence on distraction. Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies
> outside of their training sessions, you'll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration
> if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.
>
> To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say,
> having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved
> with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where,
> like the "mental wrecks" in Nass's research, it's not ready for deep work—even
> if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.
>
> Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus,
> you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction.
>
> Schedule in advance when you'll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times.
>
> It's instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities,
> at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge,
> that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.
>
> Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.
>
> One place where this strategy becomes particularly difficult outside work
> is when you're forced to wait (for example, standing in line at a store).
> It's crucial in these situations that if you're in an offline block,
> you simply gird yourself for the temporary boredom, and fight through it with only the company of your thoughts.

So hard. But I've already found my mind working on things of import during these times of boredom.

> This doesn't mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors;
> it's sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention.
>
> The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you're occupied physically
> but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—
> and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem.
>
> Memorize a Deck of Cards
>
> Rule #3 Quit Social Media
>
> The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success
> and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts
> on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.
>
> The Law of the Vital Few\*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to
> just 20 percent of the possible causes.
>
> If anything, with the rise of the Internet and the low-brow attention economy it supports,
> the average forty-hour-a-week employee—especially those in my tech-savvy Millennial generation—
> has seen the quality of his or her leisure time remain degraded,
> consisting primarily of a blur of distracted clicks on least-common-denominator digital entertainment.
>
> you both should and can make deliberate use of your time outside work, remains relevant today—
>
> when it comes to your relaxation, don't default to whatever catches your attention at the moment,
> but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend your "day within a day."
>
> It's crucial, therefore, that you figure out in advance what you're going to do
> with your evenings and weekends before they begin.

I struggle with this.

> mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg.
> All they want is change—not rest, except in sleep.
>
> If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours,
> you'll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed,
> than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing.
> To summarize, if you want to eliminate the addictive pull of entertainment sites on your time and attention,
> give your brain a quality alternative.
>
> Rule #4 Drain the Shallows
>
> Schedule Every Minute of Your Day
>
> If your schedule is disrupted, you should, at the next available moment,
> take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the time that remains in the day.
> You can turn to a new page. You can erase and redraw blocks.
> Or do as I do: Cross out the blocks for the remainder of the day
> and create new blocks to the right of the old ones on the page.
>
> This type of scheduling, however, isn't about constraint—it's instead about thoughtfulness.
> It's a simple habit that forces you to continually take a moment throughout your day
> and ask: "What makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?"
>
> Tip #1: Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work
>
> They didn't take the senders long to craft but they would require a lot of explanation
> and writing on my part to respond.
>
> Nagpal opens the article by claiming that much of the stress suffered by tenure-track professors is self-imposed.
>
> I might respond with a defense I learned from the department chair who hired me: "Talk to me after tenure."

> Second, to steal terminology from David Allen,
> a good process-centric message immediately "closes the loop" with respect to the project at hand.
