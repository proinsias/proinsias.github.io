Outline topics:

* Can have a regular dev box with standard power, and then spin up supersized machine as needed. Should have timeouts that shut down such machines when not in use for say an hour or more.
    * Can also spin up machines, one per project to parallelize the work.
* Sometimes the machine will restart and you will lose things outside of the /home/sagemaker directory.
  This forces me to practice having cattle not pets - I have a script to restore my environment.
  This could happen to your laptop. And how well could you recover?
    * How we could make this experience better - startup scripts, custom docker images
* Can leave my code running, sleep my laptop, and then wake up and check on progress.
* Heavy CPU usage does not limit my use of my laptop, as it's running on separate machine.
* You lose anything not stored in ~/SageMaker/. This includes dotfiles and ssh keys.
    * Keep a copy of the ssh keys (stored under ~/.ssh/) under ~/SageMaker/.ssh.
    * Keep a copy of your dotfiles in a branch in your git repo, and push to the remote server. More on this later.
* Use AWS S3 to store files you want to persist. The volume associated with ~/SageMaker/ has limited space. This will also improve the reproducibility of your notebooks, as otherwise team members won't be able to access files on your instance from theirs.
* Don't install new python packages except by updating a requirements.txt file under version control, and installing via this file.
  Don't install new python tools except by updating a dev-requirements.txt file under version control, and installing via this file.
  Then you can easily recreate your deleted environments by just re-installing via these files.

Here's a detailed outline covering the primary reasons people use development boxes ("dev boxes"):

1. Consistent Development Environments

    • Environment Parity: Dev boxes create a standardized environment that mirrors the production environment, reducing the risk of "it works on my machine" issues. This is especially valuable in team settings where each developer needs a consistent environment.
    • Environment Isolation: They allow for isolated, sandboxed environments to avoid conflicts with local installations or dependencies on a developer's personal machine.
    • Reproducibility: Dev boxes are often configured with specific versions of OS, libraries, and dependencies, making it easy to reproduce bugs and troubleshoot specific configurations without affecting other projects.

2. Increased Development Speed and Performance

    • High-Performance Resources: Many dev boxes offer access to high-performance CPUs, GPUs, and additional memory beyond what may be available on a developer's local machine. This is beneficial for resource-intensive tasks like training machine learning models or compiling large codebases.
    • Optimized I/O and Network Speed: Dev boxes can be provisioned close to data storage or other services in the cloud, reducing latency and improving access speeds for cloud-hosted resources.

3. Centralized and Scalable Development Infrastructure

    • Easier Scaling: Dev boxes in the cloud allow developers to scale up resources (e.g., add more memory, CPUs, or GPUs) on demand, depending on the project needs.
    • Centralized DevOps and Infrastructure Management: Centralized dev environments make it easy for DevOps teams to manage updates, patches, and configurations. They can quickly apply security patches and monitor for issues without requiring individual updates to each developer's local machine.
    • Unified Access to Shared Resources: When development requires access to shared resources (like a centralized database or high-performance cluster), dev boxes often provide a secure, streamlined way to access these resources.

4. Enhanced Security and Compliance

    • Secure Development Environment: Dev boxes can be configured with strict security protocols, data access restrictions, and encryption. Sensitive code or data can be stored and accessed securely within a managed environment, reducing the risk of exposure on a developer's personal device.
    • Compliance Management: Industries with regulatory requirements (like finance or healthcare) often require strict control over development environments. Dev boxes allow IT teams to enforce compliance controls, ensuring development environments meet necessary regulatory requirements.

5. Easy Setup, Maintenance, and Onboarding

    • Rapid Setup: Pre-configured dev boxes can be easily provisioned, allowing new developers to get started without manually installing or configuring tools. This reduces onboarding time and minimizes the chances of setup errors.
    • Automated Provisioning with Infrastructure as Code: Dev boxes are often provisioned using tools like Docker or Terraform, allowing for rapid and consistent setup of development environments.
    • Simplified Maintenance: Dev teams can easily revert or reset environments to default states, minimizing issues arising from misconfigurations or dependency conflicts.

6. Support for Remote and Collaborative Development

    • Remote Accessibility: Cloud-based dev boxes can be accessed from anywhere, making it easy for remote teams to work with high-powered resources without needing to carry high-performance hardware.
    • Collaboration-Ready: Some dev boxes support collaboration features, such as multiple users working in the same environment or sharing development sessions in real-time, which is helpful for debugging and pair programming.

7. Testing and Experimentation

    • Multiple Configurations for Testing: Dev boxes can be set up to mimic various production environments, enabling testing across different configurations. This is particularly valuable for applications that will be deployed across multiple platforms or with different dependency versions.
    • Low-Risk Experimentation: Dev boxes allow developers to experiment with new technologies, libraries, or configurations without affecting their main development environment, as they can be easily spun up or discarded.

8. Efficiency in CI/CD Integration

    • Dedicated CI/CD Resources: Dev boxes are often used to offload builds, testing, and deployments from local machines, freeing up local resources for actual development work.
    • Seamless Pipeline Integration: Since dev boxes are often part of cloud infrastructure, they integrate easily with CI/CD pipelines, automating testing, deployment, and error logging in one environment.

In summary: Dev boxes bring consistency, performance, scalability, security, and collaboration features that are crucial for modern software development, particularly in large, distributed teams and environments where security, performance, or regulatory compliance is required. Their role is especially critical as development continues to shift towards more flexible, scalable, and secure cloud environments.


Here's a detailed outline covering the key reasons why data scientists use development boxes (dev boxes):

1. Access to High-Performance Computing Resources

    • Scalable Compute Power: Many data science tasks (like training large machine learning models, processing massive datasets, or conducting parallel computations) require high computational power that is not always feasible on a local machine. Dev boxes can be provisioned with additional CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs to accelerate these tasks.
    • Enhanced Memory and Storage: Dev boxes can be configured with additional RAM and high-speed storage, allowing for handling of large datasets that may not fit into the memory of a typical local machine.
    • Efficient Data Processing: Many dev boxes are located close to cloud storage or data sources, enabling faster I/O and data transfer speeds, which can significantly reduce data loading and processing times.

2. Centralized and Consistent Development Environments

    • Environment Parity: Dev boxes allow data scientists to mirror production environments, ensuring that models or analyses developed in the dev box will work consistently when deployed. This minimizes the risk of environment-related bugs and makes collaboration smoother.
    • Pre-Configured Libraries and Tools: By pre-installing essential data science libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and tools (like Jupyter, VS Code), dev boxes provide a ready-to-use environment that speeds up development and reduces setup time.
    • Isolation of Dependencies: Dev boxes allow different projects to maintain their unique dependencies without conflicts, making it easy to manage multiple versions of libraries or frameworks across projects.

3. Efficient Data Access and Management

    • Direct Access to Data Sources: Dev boxes can be securely integrated with cloud storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) and databases, providing quick and secure access to large datasets without needing to transfer them to a local machine.
    • Data Privacy and Security: Sensitive datasets, like those used in healthcare or finance, can be stored securely on dev boxes with strict access controls, minimizing data exposure risks compared to storing data on personal devices.

4. Collaboration and Teamwork

    • Shared Workspaces: In collaborative data science projects, dev boxes enable teams to work in shared environments, making it easier to align on code, dependencies, and tools. This is helpful for projects where reproducibility and shared results are essential.
    • Remote Accessibility: Dev boxes can be accessed remotely, enabling data scientists to work from any location with a consistent setup. This is particularly valuable for remote teams or data scientists working in different locations.
    • Real-Time Collaboration: Some dev boxes support collaborative tools, allowing multiple users to view, edit, or run code in real-time, which is helpful for pair programming, debugging, or peer reviews.

5. Experimentation and Model Training

    • Dedicated Environment for Experimentation: Dev boxes provide a sandboxed environment where data scientists can test new libraries, tools, or modeling approaches without affecting their main environment or risking dependency conflicts.
    • Parallel Experimentation: With access to scalable resources, data scientists can run multiple experiments in parallel, such as hyperparameter tuning or model selection, which can speed up the experimentation phase.
    • Tracking and Logging of Experiments: Dev boxes can be integrated with tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases, making it easier to track experiment metadata, configurations, and results across multiple iterations.

6. Improved Workflow with Data Science Tools and IDEs

    • Access to Jupyter and VS Code: Many dev boxes are pre-configured with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, making it easy to conduct data analysis in an interactive and visual format. For more extensive code bases, IDEs like VS Code are often supported, providing a familiar development experience.
    • Integration with Data Science Pipelines: Dev boxes support the use of automated pipelines for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, streamlining the entire data science workflow.
    • Visualization and Reporting: With enhanced memory and processing, dev boxes enable faster generation of data visualizations and dashboards, often supported by tools like Plotly, Bokeh, or Dash.

7. Compliance, Security, and Governance

    • Controlled and Auditable Environment: For fields like healthcare, finance, or government, dev boxes provide centralized environments that comply with strict security regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), allowing organizations to monitor and control data access and usage.
    • Data Encryption and Access Controls: By hosting data on secure dev boxes, organizations can enforce role-based access and encryption standards, ensuring that only authorized users can access or process sensitive information.
    • Logging and Monitoring for Security: Dev boxes often support integration with monitoring tools, allowing organizations to track user activity, access patterns, and potential security threats within the environment.

8. Seamless Integration with MLOps and Deployment Pipelines

    • Model Lifecycle Management: Dev boxes can integrate with MLOps frameworks, facilitating the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.
    • Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Dev boxes can serve as staging areas for CI/CD pipelines, enabling data scientists to test model deployment and automation workflows in environments that closely mirror production.
    • Monitoring and Scaling of Deployed Models: After deployment, dev boxes can be used to monitor model performance, identify drift, and trigger retraining as needed, ensuring models remain accurate and relevant.

9. Cost Efficiency and Flexibility

    • On-Demand Resource Provisioning: With cloud-based dev boxes, data scientists can request resources only when needed, reducing the cost associated with idle infrastructure.
    • Flexible Cost Management: Dev boxes allow organizations to adjust resources on the fly, giving the flexibility to scale up for compute-heavy tasks and scale down during idle times.
    • Pay-As-You-Go Model: For data science projects that vary in intensity, a pay-as-you-go pricing model for dev boxes can be more cost-effective than investing in expensive local infrastructure that may be underused.

In summary: Dev boxes provide data scientists with a centralized, scalable, and secure environment that simplifies access to computational resources, streamlines data access and experimentation, and supports collaboration and compliance. They are particularly valuable for handling large-scale data and complex machine learning workflows while reducing setup time and improving reproducibility across team members and environments.

Here's a summary of the main cons of using dev boxes in general, with some specific challenges for data science:

General Cons of Using Dev Boxes

    1.  Cost: Running high-performance dev boxes, especially in the cloud, can become expensive over time, particularly if resources are not managed efficiently.
    2.  Network Dependency: Dev boxes typically rely on stable internet connections, which can impact productivity if connectivity issues arise.
    3.  Setup and Maintenance Overhead: Initial configuration can be complex, and ongoing management requires DevOps support, particularly for maintaining software updates, security patches, and backups.
    4.  Security Risks: Cloud-based dev boxes carry inherent security risks, such as exposure to unauthorized access or potential breaches if not secured properly.
    5.  Learning Curve: For teams new to dev boxes or cloud environments, there can be a significant learning curve, as developers need to understand virtual environments, remote tools, and access protocols.

Data Science-Specific Cons of Using Dev Boxes

    1.  Data Transfer Latency and Cost: Large datasets can incur latency and additional costs when transferring between storage and dev boxes, especially when data is stored in different cloud regions.
    2.  Resource Allocation Limits: Scaling resources can be limited by organizational budgets or cloud provider restrictions, which can affect large-scale computations or complex model training needs.
    3.  Dependency on Cloud Providers: Data scientists relying on cloud-based dev boxes may experience vendor lock-in, which can complicate migrations to different platforms or on-premises solutions.
    4.  Environmental Replication Challenges: Reproducing exact environments between dev boxes and production can still be challenging, especially with complex dependencies in machine learning libraries and frameworks.
    5.  Potential for Underutilization: Data scientists may not always use the full capacity of a dev box, leading to wasted resources and higher costs if resource allocation isn't actively managed.


I've previously written down my thoughts on how to apply the DevOps principal of relying on "cattle" and not on "pets" to my laptops – that is, make sure your computer systems are easily rebuilt in case of a disaster, so you are not reliant on a fragile and irreplaceable setup. This is usually accomplished by representing via configuration files the state of a system, that is, what applications, documents, and system configuration are present.

Here are some thoughts on how to apply this principle to your SageMaker instance. Feel free to leave comments or suggestions, including your own thoughts, tips, and best practices.

Disaster scenarios
Here are three potential disasters to consider to put yourself in the right frame of mind:

Your SageMaker instance is rebooted

Your SageMaker instance is deleted

You are hit by a bus (!)

Scenario 1: How to survive a reboot
When your instance is rebooted, a few things happen, and here's how to survive them.

You lose anything not stored in ~/SageMaker/. This includes dotfiles and ssh keys.

Keep a copy of the ssh keys (stored under ~/.ssh/) under ~/SageMaker/.ssh.

Keep a copy of your dotfiles in a branch in your git repo, and push to the remote server. More on this later.

Use AWS S3 to store files you want to persist. The volume associated with ~/SageMaker/ has limited space. This will also improve the reproducibility of your notebooks, as otherwise team members won't be able to access files on your instance from theirs.

You lose your cron jobs.

Keep a copy of your crontab in a branch in your git repo. You can save your crontab using crontab -l > crontab.txt and reload it using crontab crontab.txt.

You lose your conda environments.

Don't install new python packages except by updating a requirements.txt file under version control, and installing via this file.

Don't install new python tools except by updating a dev-requirements.txt file under version control, and installing via this file.

Then you can easily recreate your deleted environments by just re-installing via these files.

Keep your python version up to date when you have the time, so that you won't be forced to use a later version when you don't have the time.

Test this system! Actually restart your machine when you have the time, so you won't be forced to find our your recovery system fails when you don't have the time to deal with it.

Scenario 2: How to survive a deletion
Much of what you'll lose in this situation is covered by scenario 1. However, now you also lose whatever's under ~/SageMaker. So:

Don't keep anything in ~/SageMaker you don't want to lose. Keep it in AWS S3 instead.

Make sure all your code is checked into source control. It's easy to forget that you have local changes that are not yet synced to the remote repository. I use the uncommitted tool to find these changes across my machine, or just in a certain directory.

Really do keep your dotfiles in a branch in your git repo and push to the remote server.

Scenario 3: How to survive being hit by a bus
Well actually, this section is more about how your colleagues will survive you being hit by a bus. Hopefully you'll be able to get the best medical treatment, rest plenty, and come back to us soon!

And this section only applies to instances that run prediction endpoints in "production", that is they send predictions to customers via emails, Tableau Dashboards, or our iQueue product.

Document your endpoints well, and provide good test coverage, so that a complete newbie can understand your code, run your code, and test that their modifications to your code don't break things.

Document your cron jobs well, and provide a test mode for the underlying scripts that does not affect production data or email tenants.

Send any email produced to your entire Data Science team and not just one individual. Note that you should notify your team of new emails they should expect to receive, so that they can setup suitable filters to handle this "bacon". Similarly, send slack notifications to a channel that all your Data Science team members have joined (and may mute until necessary). The purpose of this step is to ensure that any team member can step in and review an error or other issue, without being blocked because they didn't receive some key message.

Ideally, the requests to and responses from your endpoints should be tracked in a production or analytics table similar to the production table analyze_future_volume_job used for our future volume predictions. Again, this facilitates someone jumping in and rapidly reproducing the issue by sending the same payload to the endpoint.
