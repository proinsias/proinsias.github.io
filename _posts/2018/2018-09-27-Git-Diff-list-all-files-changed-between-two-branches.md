The `git-diff` command can help with finding all files that have changed
between two branches. For instance, if you are at the `HEAD` of your current
feature branch and you'd like to see the list of files that have changed
since being in sync with the `master` branch, you'd formulate a command like
the following:

```bash
git diff --name-only master
```

The `--name-only` flag is important because it cuts out the rest of the
non-essential output.

You'll want to list the _older_ branch first and the current branch second
as a way of showing what has changed from the original branch to get to the
current branch.

Though the example shows the use of _branches_ any git reference can be used
to see what has changed between two commits.

See `man git-diff` for more details.
