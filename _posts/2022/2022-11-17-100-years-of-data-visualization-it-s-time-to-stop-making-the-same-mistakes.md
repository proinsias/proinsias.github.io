I just watched the very informative webinar below from
[Data Science Central](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/)
called
[100 Years of Data Visualization – It’s Time to Stop Making the Same Mistakes](https://vimeo.com/141091383).
In it, [Andy Cotgreave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acotgreave/)
reviews some data visualization tips from a 1914 book
[Graphic methods for presenting facts](https://archive.org/details/graphicmethodsfo00brinrich/mode/2up)
by Willard Brinton that many data visualizers can still learn from. For example:

1. Don’t size by area. We are terrible at comparing relative size by area.
2. Start your axis at zero, **unless you’re dealing with relative data**.

<div style="max-width:854px">
<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%">
<iframe

width="640"
height="480"
frameborder="0"
allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
</div>
</div>


Andy also recommends _slightly_ (/s) more recent books on data visualization:

* [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi).
* [Show Me the Numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten](https://a.co/fp42L70).
* [Communicating Data with Tableau](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/communicating-data-with/9781449372019/).
