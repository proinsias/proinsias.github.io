A standard use of the `history` command will output line numbers as well as the commands in your history:

```shell
> history
  1  ls
  2  du -ks my_file.txt
  3  rm my_file.txt
```

The line numbers are useful for when you want to repeat a command â€“ you can refer to it by the line number as follows:

```shell
> !1
my_file.txt
```

But if you want to save a lot of commands from your history and not have to edit out the line numbers, you can simply use:

```shell
> history -w /dev/stdout
ls
du -ks my_file.txt
rm my_file.txt
history
ls
```

The `-w` option tells `history` to write the current history to a file. In the above version we redirect to the standard output instead of a file.
