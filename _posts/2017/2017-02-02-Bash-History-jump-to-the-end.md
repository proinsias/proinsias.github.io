There are all sorts of ways to do things in your shell environment without
reaching for the arrow keys. For instance, if you want to move _up_ to the
previous command, you can hit `Ctrl-p`. To move _down_ to the next
command in your shell history, you can hit `Ctrl-n`.

But what if you want to move to the beginning and end of your entire shell
history?

Find your meta key (probably the one labeled `alt`) and hit `META-<` and
`META->` to move to the end and beginning of your shell history,
respectively.
