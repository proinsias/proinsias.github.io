With only a few lines of code, you get caching of the output of any function:

```python
import tempfile

import sklearn.externals

memory = sklearn.externals.joblib.Memory(
    cachedir=tempfile.mkdtemp(),
    verbose=0,
)


@memory.cache
def computation(p1, p2):
    pass
```

To clear the cache, use [`memory.clear()`](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.Memory.html).

## Comparison with memoize

> The memoize decorator caches in memory all the inputs
> and outputs of a function call.
> Using memoize with large objects will consume all the memory, where with Memory,
> objects are persisted to disk, using a persister optimized for speed and memory usage.
> Memoize is best suited for functions with "small" input and output objects,
> whereas Memory is best suited for functions with complex input and output objects,
> and aggressive persistence to disk.

## Gotchas

> memory is designed for pure functions and it is not recommended to use it for methods.
> If you want to use cache inside a class the recommended pattern is to cache a pure function
> and use the cached function inside your class, i.e. something like this:

```python
@mem.cache
def compute_func(arg1, arg2, arg3):
    # long computation
    return result


class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, args):
        self.data = None

    def compute(self):
        self.data = compute_func(self.arg1, self.arg2, 40)
```

> Using Memory for methods is not recommended and has some caveats that make it very fragile
> from a maintenance point of view because it is very easy to forget about these caveats
> when your software evolves. If you still want to do it, here are a few known caveats:
> \[First, y\]ou cannot decorate a method at class definition.
> The following code won't work:

```python
class Foo(object):
    @mem.cache  # WRONG
    def method(self, args):
        pass
```

> The right way to do this is to decorate at instantiation time:

```python
class Foo(object):

    def __init__(self, args):
        self.method = mem.cache(self.method)

    def method(self, ...):
        pass
```

> \[Second, t\]he cached method will have self as one of its arguments.
> That means that the result will be recomputed if anything with self changes.

## Ignoring some arguments

> It may be useful not to recalculate a function when certain arguments change,
> for instance a debug flag. Memory provides the `ignore` list:

```python
>>> @memory.cache(ignore=['debug'])
... def my_func(x, debug=True):
...     print('Called with x = %s' % x)
>>> my_func(0)
Called with x = 0
>>> my_func(0, debug=False)
>>> my_func(0, debug=True)
>>> # my_func was not reevaluated
```
