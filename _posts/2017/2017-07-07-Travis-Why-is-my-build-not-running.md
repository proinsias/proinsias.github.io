You can get logs useful for debugging your Travis builds using either:

- The [`travis requests`](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#requests) command, or
- The requests page on the Travis CI [web page](https://travis-ci.com/) via the 'cog menu'
  on the upper right.

Via [travis-ci.com](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-05-12-why-is-my-build-not-running/).
