> Sometimes you push to Travis CI and there is no new build. What to do in such case? Has
Travis CI got your commits? Is the branch you were using disabled? Do you need to tweak
some settings? You no longer need to ask these questions!

You can get logs useful for debugging your Travis builds using either:

* The [`travis requests`](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#requests) command, or
* The requests page on the Travis CI [web page](https://travis-ci.com/) via the 'cog menu'
  on the upper right.

Via [travis-ci.com](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-05-12-why-is-my-build-not-running/).
