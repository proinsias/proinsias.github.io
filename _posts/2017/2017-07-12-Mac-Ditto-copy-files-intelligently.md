> `ditto` is slightly more advanced but can be advantageous to 'cp' for several reasons,
> as it not only preserves ownership attributes and permissions but also file resource forks
> and file and folder metadata, essentially insuring that the file and/or folders are copied
> exactly.
> Additionally, `ditto` can be used to copy a file or folder to a source directory, but if
> that source doesn't yet exist, `ditto` will automatically create it.
> Also, if the destination folder does exist, the copied contents will be merged together in
> that destination directory.
> Finally, `ditto` also follows symbolic links, making it particularly handy if you're a
> heavy user of the `ln` command.

```bash
ditto source destination
```

> `ditto` will check to see if the destination already exists, and if it does, it will
> merge the directories of the source to the destination:

```bash
ditto ~/Pictures/Fall2015/ /Volumes/PhotoBackup/2015/
```

> If for some reason you don't want to copy metadata and resource forks, use the `â€“norsrc`
> flag.
