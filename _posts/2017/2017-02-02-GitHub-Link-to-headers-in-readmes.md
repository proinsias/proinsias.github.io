Anytime you add a header to a markdown file, GitHub attaches an `href` with its
downcased name. 'JavaScript' receives a link to `#javascript`, for instance.

Leverage this by adding a table of contents to your README with links to the
headers further down the document:

```markdown
### Table of Contents

-   [Cucumber](#cucumber)
```

This will link to a header containing 'Cucumber'.
