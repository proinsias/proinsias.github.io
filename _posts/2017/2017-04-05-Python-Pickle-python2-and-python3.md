The python3 `pickle.load()` function has optional keyword arguments that can be used to control compatibility support for pickle stream generated by Python 2:

- If `fix_imports` is `True`, `pickle` will try to map the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3.
- The `encoding` and `errors` tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string instances pickled by Python 2.
