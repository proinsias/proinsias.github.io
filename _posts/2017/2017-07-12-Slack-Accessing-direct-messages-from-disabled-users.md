> You can't actually delete a user in Slack.
> You can, however, disable a user.
> And the cool thing about disabled users is that you can still access the messages you've
> sent to them.
>
> Accessing the messages is simple.
> First go to your Team Directory page in Slack.
> The url for that is something like <http://yourteam.slack.com/team>.
> Now find the greyed out "Disabled Accounts" section.
> Click on it.
> Next to each of the users you will see a \[â€¦\] menu.
> Open that menu and select "Open Message Archives".
>
> You can now view your archived direct messages from previous members of your team.
>
> It is also possible to access messages from a disabled user using the Slack search
> functionality.
> In order to do this you can simply enter `from:@userName` (where `username` is the name of
> the user you are looking for) in the Slack search bar.
> The search results should actually show you messages from the disabled user.
