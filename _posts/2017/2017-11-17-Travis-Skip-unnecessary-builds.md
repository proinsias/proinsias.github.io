> Especially when you're working with a large team with multiple Travis-enabled repositories,
> you'll want to avoid running any unnecessary builds.
> The most common reason a build might be unnecessary is that it's just a documentation or comment change.
> For simple changes like these, add "\[ci skip\]" to your commit message,
> and Travis will automatically skip that build.
