Top tips on better descriptive statistics:

-   Instead of the mean, use the median and/or the mode.
-   Instead of the standard deviation, use the mean absolute deviation, the median absolute deviation,
    or the interquartile range.
-   Instead of z-scores, use percentile ranks.
-   Instead of skewness, use a QQ-plot or a histogram.
-   Instead of x standard deviations from the mean, use x median absolute deviations from the median.
-   Instead of correlation metrics, just use a scatterplot.
