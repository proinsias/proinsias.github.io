> In Python 3.6, variables (in global, class or local scope) can now have type annotations
> using either of the following two forms:

```python
foo: Optional[int]
bar: List[str] = []
```

> Mypy fully supports this syntax, interpreting them as equivalent to:

```python
foo = None  # type: Optional[int]
bar = []  # type: List[str]
```
