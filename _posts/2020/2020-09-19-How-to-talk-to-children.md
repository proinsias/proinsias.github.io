As a parent of two small children, I have to constantly remind myself
that some positive or negative event that seems trivial to me may be
incredible or devastating to a child. And in order to get a message
across to them, I have to step into their shoes and see the world
through their eyes, to use some clich√©s.

[Fred Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers)
was widely seen as a great communicator to kids, and this was due to a
great effort on his part to choose carefully every word spoken on his
program. [This Atlantic
article](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352)
highlights a summary of this progress by some of Mr. Rodger's
colleagues:

1. "State the idea you wish to express as clearly as possible, and in
   terms preschoolers can understand."
   Example: _It is dangerous to play in the street._

2. "Rephrase in a positive manner," as in _It is good to play where it
   is safe._

3. "Rephrase the idea, bearing in mind that preschoolers cannot yet
   make subtle distinctions and need to be redirected to authorities they
   trust." As in, _Ask your parents where it is safe to play._

4. "Rephrase your idea to eliminate all elements that could be
   considered prescriptive, directive, or instructive." In the example,
   that'd mean getting rid of "ask": _Your parents will tell you where it
   is safe to play._

5. "Rephrase any element that suggests certainty." That'd be "will":
   _Your parents can tell you where it is safe to play._

6. "Rephrase your idea to eliminate any element that may not apply to
   all children." Not all children know their parents, so: _Your favorite
   grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play._

7. "Add a simple motivational idea that gives preschoolers a reason to
   follow your advice." Perhaps: _Your favorite grown-ups can tell you
   where it is safe to play. It is good to listen to them._

8. "Rephrase your new statement, repeating the first step." "Good"
   represents a value judgment, so: _Your favorite grown-ups can tell you
   where it is safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them._

9. "Rephrase your idea a final time, relating it to some phase of
   development a preschooler can understand." Maybe: _Your favorite
   grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is important to
   try to listen to them, and listening is an important part of growing._
