One of the major differentiators between a new Data Scientist and a
more experienced one is how the more senior practitioner spends a lot
of time understanding the impact of the work, not just the performance
of any given model.

[Jesse Heap](https://towardsdatascience.com/@jjheap) has a great
[article](https://towardsdatascience.com/call-to-data-scientists-stop-using-measures-like-accuracy-precision-or-recall-1441f405e500)
of how to maximize the impact and adoption of your work.
Here are the highlights:

1. Remember that "key business stakeholders are often reluctant to
   implement ... a new model unless they can clearly understand how it
   could drive significant impact against their key business metrics",
   yet typically they "do not have the proper training to help interpret,
   understand and properly apply the output from our models".

2. You must "defin\[e\] what success looks like in the language of your
   stakeholder", and "make sure \[you\] are comparing results against how
   things are currently being done".

3. Once you understand success enough to define what metrics to use,
   ensure that "these metrics ... are discussed prior to any
   project and in collaboration with your key stakeholders".

4. And finally, "before jumping right to an advanced ML model, ensure you are
   exploring simpler approaches first."
