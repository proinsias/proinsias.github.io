Since ancient times, mankind has studied the sky and wondered what
those
“[wandering stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_planet)”
(the solar system planets) might be.  Centuries of observations of
these celestial bodies led to the realization that Earth was not the
center of the universe and the development of Newton’s
[Theory of Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity). At the end
of the last century, having run out of new planets to study,
astronomers began to look beyond the reach of our own Sun, and search
for planets in orbit around distant stars. In the decade since, we
have found over two hundred planets<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> outside
our solar system, and continue to examine nearby stars for evidence of
planetary companions.

properties. Credit: [Jeffrey Hall](https://lowell.edu/staff-member/jeffrey-hall/)

In this age of billion-dollar telescopes that dwarf houses, it would
be reasonable to assume that each of these discoveries was made using
the latest and greatest technology. However, one of the most recently
discovered “exoplanets” was identified using a trio of amateur
telescopes. The humble telescopes used in the discovery were built
using off-the-shelf 10-cm camera lenses. The three telescopes shown in
[Figure 1](#fig1) – [Sleuth](/portfolio/tres.html), the Planet Search Survey Telescope and the STellar
Astrophysics and Research on Exoplanets
([STARE](http://www.hao.ucar.edu/research/stare/stare.html)) telescope
– form a network called the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey
([TrES](../index.html)).
Our TrES team has so far<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> identified two
planets, imaginatively called
[TrES-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrES-1b) and
[TrES-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrES-2b). They are transiting
exoplanets, so called because they “transit” or pass in front of their
stars (see [Figure 2](#fig2)).  When a planet transits a star, it blocks a
small fraction of the starlight, and the star appears to dim. This is
similar to what we saw during the recent transit of the Sun by the
planet Mercury. For distant stars, though, we cannot take an image of
the star’s disk, so instead we measure the amount of light coming from
it using a digital camera. Although 200 exoplanets are known,
transiting exoplanets are rarer, with only
14<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> known today. These two planets can also
be classified as
“[hot Jupiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter)”. They are
similar in mass and size to Jupiter, and yet they are closer to their
stars than Mercury is to our Sun! The proximity of the star means that
such a planet experiences intense radiation from the star, making the
planet hotter than a more-isolated planet like Jupiter.  These
precious transiting hot Jupiters are the only planets outside of our
solar system for which we can precisely measure the size and mass of
the planet.  Before the discovery of the transiting planets, we only
had the four gas giants within our solar system (Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune) with which to study how these giant planets form
and evolve. This meant that our understanding was limited.

We determine the radius of a transiting planet from the amount of
starlight that it blocks. A larger planet would block a larger
fraction of light, and the star would appear to dim to a greater
extent. We can determine the mass of the planet by measuring the
effect the mass of the planet has on the star. The Sun attracts
Jupiter and hence causes Jupiter to circle around it in a 12 year
orbit. However, Jupiter also attracts the Sun, and causes the Sun to
circle, albeit in a much smaller orbit. A distant observer outside the
solar system could deduce the presence of Jupiter by observing this
“wobble” of the Sun. In a similar way, we can measure the mass of a
transiting planet by observing the movement of its host star. Note
that in neither case do we directly detect the planet, only the effect
the planet has on the star, either by blocking its light or causing it
to move in a small circular orbit.

Although TrES-2 was first identified using a 10-cm telescope, we could
not be certain that the transit dip that we saw was caused by a
planet. It was possible that we were instead seeing an eclipsing
binary system, where two stars are in orbit around each other and take
turns passing across the disk of their companion.  In order to measure
the mass of the transiting companion in our candidate planetary
system, and thereby determine whether it was a planet or a star, we
had to scale up our equipment. We observed our target star with one of
the 10-m telescopes at the
[W.M. Keck Observatory](http://www.keckobservatory.org/) on the summit
of [Mauna Kea, Hawaii](http://w3w.co/fiesta.registration.repeat) (see
[Figure 3](#fig3)). We measured the wobble of this star, and concluded that the
companion was a Jupiter-mass planet.  The past few months have truly
been an exciting time for astronomers looking for new
exoplanets. TrES-2 is the most massive of the nearby transiting
planets and sets a new constraint for our models of how these gas
giants form around stars. TrES-2, announcd in September, was also the
first of four new planets to be presented within a few weeks. Three of
these planets have posed theorists a new challenge. Prior to the
discovery of the planets TrES-2,
[HAT-P-1b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAT-P-1b), and
[WASP-1b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASP-1b), there was only one
transiting planet that these theorists were puzzled by. Using models
based on the solar system gas giants, and including the effect of the
heat from the nearby star, they were able to explain how the mass of a
hot Jupiter should relate to its radius. And their models correctly
predicted the observed planetary radii, except for one transiting
planet, [HD 209458b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_209458_b). With
one oddball, it’s easy to dismiss it as a rare case.  However, TrES-2,
HAT-P-1b and WASP- 1b are all larger than we would expect.  Now we
have to go back to the drawing board and try to figure out why these
planets are so puffed up.

The planet TrES-2 is also noteworthy for being the first transiting
planet in an area of the sky known as the
“[Kepler field](http://kepler.nasa.gov/Science/about/targetFieldOfView/)”,
which has been singled out as the target field of view for the
upcoming NASA [Kepler](http://www.kepler.nasa.gov) mission. Using a
satellite-based telescope, Kepler will stare at this patch of sky for
four years, and should discover hundreds of giant planets and even
Earth-like planets.  Finding a planet in the Kepler field allows
astronomers to plan future observations with Kepler that include
searching for moons around TrES-2.

The TrES network of telescopes is illustrative of the new age of
astronomy when novel ideas and new technologies are changing the way
we study the night sky. Telescopes are located high up on mountain
tops, where they can try to avoid low-lying clouds and some
atmospheric effects. Despite the location in warm areas such as
California or Hawaii, observing in an open dome on a mountain top used
to be a chilling experience, requiring passion, discipline and lots of
coffee. Thankfully, the frostbitten fingertips of graduate students
need no longer be sacrificed on the altar of science. With the
development of computer controlled telescopes, observers are able to
stay warm in climate-controlled rooms. In fact, long-distance
observing is now a reality. The Keck telescopes require only a
technician be present in the dome of the telescopes. The scientists
can control the instrumentation on the telescopes from a sea-level
control room near Mauna Kea, or even from
[Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) in California! In the case of the
TrES telescopes, all the required actions are scripted in advance, and
computer runs this script during the night. In the morning, the
observations are transferred over the internet to the observer’s home
computer.

The three telescopes also act as backups for each other during periods
of bad weather. For example, the [PSST](https://web.archive.org/web/20060912132008/http://www.lowell.edu/Research/PSST.html) at
[Lowell Observatory](https://lowell.edu/) in Arizona experiences a
monsoon every summer, during which very little observing is
possible. Since the summer nights at
[Palomar Observatory](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/homepage.html)
in California are generally clear, the Sleuth telescope can observe
the target field while the PSST is weather-logged. The telescopes can
also work in shifts, taking turns to observe the night sky as the sun
rotates around the other side of the Earth.  STARE in the Canaries
begins observing first each night, whereas Sleuth can continue
monitoring the night sky long after the sun has risen over STARE.

This discovery using telescopes placed in multiple locations required
an international team of astronomers, from various institutions like
Caltech, [Harvard University](http://www.harvard.edu/), the
[Canary Islands Institute of Astronomy](http://www.iac.es/index.php?lang=en),
and the Lowell Observatory (fittingly, as the institute where
[Clyde Tombaugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Tombaugh)
discovered Pluto in 1930). It also required countless man-hours be
poured into taking these cheap telescopes and turning them into useful
and automated scientific tools. The payback from all this hard work
and cooperation in the ability to sleep peacefully, knowing each night
that these humble and tireless workhorses are scanning the heavens for
new exoplanets.
