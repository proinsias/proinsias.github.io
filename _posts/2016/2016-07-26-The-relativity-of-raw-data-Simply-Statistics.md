Data scientists often say that they want access to the 'raw data'
â€“ but what does that term mean?

If you're interested in how to maintain this "chain of custody",
check out [Recipy](https://github.com/recipy/recipy), an "effortless method to record provenance in Python".
You simply add a single line of code to your Python code,
and `Recipy` will keep track of how exactly your output files were created.
