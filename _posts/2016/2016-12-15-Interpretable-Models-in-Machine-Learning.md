This month, the 20th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks,
Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning held a special session
on "Interpretable Models in Machine Learning". Here's the introductory
paper for the session: [Making machine learning models
interpretable](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ce0b/8b6fca7dc089548cc2e9aaac3bae82bb19da.pdf).
