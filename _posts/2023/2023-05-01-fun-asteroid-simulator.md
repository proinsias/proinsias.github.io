I came across [Neal Agarwal](https://twitter.com/nealagarwal)'s portfolio site of fun web projects recently.

A great example is the [Asteroid Launcher](https://neal.fun/asteroid-launcher/).
You select the type, size, speed, and impact angle of a fictitious asteroid,
and then pick where on Earth the asteroid should hit.
You then get a rather scary presentation of what would happen next.

Thankfully these things don't happen that often â€“ though they happen often enough
that we should [worry](https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/overview) about them.
