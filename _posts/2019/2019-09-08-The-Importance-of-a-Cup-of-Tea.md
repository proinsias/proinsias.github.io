Could you tell the difference between the taste of a cup of tea where the milk was poured first,
and one where the milk was poured last?

In 1919, an English lady, Dr. Muriel Bristol, declared that she could.
A statistician named Ronald Fisher set out not only to disprove her claim,
but to do so in as mathematically sound a manner as possible.

As it happens, Dr. Bristol defended her discriminating palate.

> By the eighth cup Fisher was goggle-eyed behind his spectacles. Bristol had gotten every single one correct.

Trying to understand the significance of this result inspired Fisher
to develop novel rigorous statistical methods for testing hypotheses.

> Fisher published the fruit of his research in two seminal books,
> Statistical Methods for Research Workers and The Design of Experiments.
> The latter introduced several fundamental ideas,
> including the null hypothesis and statistical significance,
> that scientists worldwide still use today.
> And the first example Fisher used in his book, to set the tone for everything that followed,
> was Muriel Bristol's tea test.
