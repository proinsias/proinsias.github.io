I mostly clone GitHub and Bitbucket repositories using SSH URLs,
so that I can protect this access with an SSH private/public key pair.
Unfortunately, some firewalls refuse to allow SSH connections.
Thankfully both [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/using-ssh-over-the-https-port)
and
[Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/troubleshoot-ssh-issues-271943403.html#TroubleshootSSHissues-Ifport22isblocked)
support using an SSH connection made over the HTTPS port.
Most firewall rules should allow this â€“ though proxy servers may still interfere.

To enable this, edit `~/.ssh/config`, and add the following section:

```shell
Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443
Host bitbucket.org
  Hostname altssh.bitbucket.org
  Port 443
```
