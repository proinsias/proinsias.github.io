Microsoft Research's danah boyd has been given an award by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org/),
and gave a magnificent
[speech](https://web.archive.org/web/20191213222537/https://onezero.medium.com/facing-the-great-reckoning-head-on-8fe434e10630)
on her experience as a women in technology.
My favorite part is about how to create a healthy society:

> "Move fast and break things" is an abomination if your goal is to create a healthy society.
> Taking shortcuts may be financially profitable in the short-term,
> but the cost to society is too great to be justified.
> In a healthy society,
> we accommodate differently-abled people through accessibility standards,
> not because it's financially prudent but because it's the right thing to do.
> In a healthy society,
> we make certain that the vulnerable amongst us are not harassed into silence
> because that is not the value behind free speech.
> In a healthy society,
> we strategically design to increase social cohesion
> because binaries are machine logic not human logic.
