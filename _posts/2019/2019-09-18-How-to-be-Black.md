I just finished Baratunde Thurston's [_How to be Black_](https://howtobeblack.me/),
a wonderful "satirical guide to race issues – written for black people and those who love them".

I highly recommend it, especially the audiobook verison where you get the author's narration and original recordings from the interviewees.
