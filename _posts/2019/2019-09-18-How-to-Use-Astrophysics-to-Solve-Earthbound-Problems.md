The cross-pollination that naturally occurs when people move along a diverse career path
is of great benefit to the areas they find themselves in.
This was emphasized during my early training as a physicist,
with researchers moving back and forth between academic and industry jobs.
However when I continued on to study astrophysics,
I found that there wasn't an obvious path for such cross-pollination.
This is one of the reasons I left that field as a post-doc.

In the below recent
[TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/federica_bianco_how_we_use_astrophysics_to_study_earthbound_problems),
a fellow astrophysicist describes how she manages to find this cross-pollination,
and to apply her data analysis skills to solve, not only mysteries of the universe,
but more local urban and social problems as well.
