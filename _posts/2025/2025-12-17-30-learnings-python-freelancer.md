I found some 
[tips and general thoughts](https://lerner.co.il/2025/12/08/30-things-ive-learned-from-30-years-in-business/)
on what it takes to be a successful freelancer, and why that career can be so fulfilling.
Some highlights:

> Being an excellent programmer isn’t enough to succeed as a freelancer.

> Be open to changing the direction of your career.

> It's better to be an expert in a small, well-defined domain than a generalist.
> ...
> That said, it's also important to have a wide body of knowledge. Read anything you can.

> My father used to say, "I never met a con man I didn’t like."
> And indeed, the clients who failed to pay me were always the sweetest, nicest people... until they failed to pay.

> Being in business means being an optimist, believing that you can succeed even when things are tough.

> If you can pay money to save time, do it.

> Learn how to learn new things quickly, and to integrate those new things into what you already know.
