One of the reasons that having too many meetings can really kill productivity is that you are left with no time to actually prepare for the meeting beforehand or take immediate action on next steps afterwards.

As a manager, I would make the time to prepare for my 1-on-1s with my direct reports, as it was an obvious part of my job description.

But it took some time and experience to realize how even more important it was to make the same time to prepare for my 1-on-1s with my managers.
Important for my job performance, yes, but also for my career development
It was my opportunity to hold my manager accountable for helping me achieve great things.

So make the most of your 1-on-1s. And this is a great guide to doing exactly that.
