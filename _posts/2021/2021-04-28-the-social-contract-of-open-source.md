I'm a huge fan of open source software. Much of my work and play involve using it, either directly or indirectly.
And so I'm a big proponent of people giving back to open source and the community that supports it –
especially companies that benefit so immensely from open source –
rather than just taking it for granted, or worse complaining about imperfections in this free offering.

[Brett Cannon](https://twitter.com/brettsky) has a great post about
[The social contract of open source](https://snarky.ca/the-social-contract-of-open-source/)
that discusses this issue, and offers some insights into
how people who benefit from open source should act. In summary:

> Every commit of open source code should be viewed as an independent gift from the maintainer
> that they happened to leave on their front yard for others to enjoy if they so desire;
> treating them as a means to and for their open source code is unethical.

So please be kind to your open source maintainers.
