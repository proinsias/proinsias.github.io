In case you haven't noticed, I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to create my blog from markdown files.
And I typically write short posts, mostly TILs like this one. But I am trying to write longer, more thoughtful posts,
which means that I will likely need to write drafts of these posts.

Well Jekyll has a nice [feature](https://uhded.com/jekyll-drafts)
where you can save these drafts in a folder (`_drafts`)
separate from the one used to contain your completed posts (`_posts`).
That way the draft won't be made available at your website until you are ready to move it to the `_posts` folder.

But wait! There's more!!!

> You can view the posts (most likely locally) in the `_drafts` folder using the `--drafts`flag:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
```

> Also, the posts in the `_drafts` folder typically don't have the date in the file name.
> i.e instead of `2020-01-01-post-1.md`, it would be `post-1.md`.
> You add the date after you move it to the `_posts` folder.
>
> If you want to keep the dates in the filename of the drafts, then run:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --future
```
