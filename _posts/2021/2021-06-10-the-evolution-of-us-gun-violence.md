[post](https://web.archive.org/web/20210428015229/https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/april-19-2021#)
on the evolution of gun violence in the US and the associated legislation:

> America today is caught in a plague of gun violence.
>
> It wasn't always this way. Americans used to own guns without engaging in daily massacres.
> Indeed, it always jumps out at me that the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929,
> when members of one Chicago gang set up and killed seven members of a rival gang,
> was so shocking it led to legislation that prohibits automatic weapons in the U.S.
>
> Eighty-nine years later, though, in 2018, another Valentine's Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School
> in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 children and wounded 17 others.
> In response, then-President Donald Trump called for arming teachers,
> and the Republican-dominated Florida legislature rejected a bill that would have limited some high-capacity guns.

> Our acceptance of violence today stands in striking contrast to Americans' horror
> at the 1929 Valentine's Day Massacre.
