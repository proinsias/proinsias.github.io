Here's a list of some of the projects I've been involved in over the years:

<!-- FIXME: Keep adding from HIQ. -->

-   [Accurately predicting surgical case lengths](https://web.archive.org/web/20221109153007/https://www.hospiq.com/blog/in-the-or-accuracy-in-scheduling-is-everything/)
    to optimize OR scheduling.

-   [Proactively planning for patient discharges](https://web.archive.org/web/20230124154310/https://www.hospiq.com/blog/proactive-discharge-planning-managing-patient-stays-to-optimize-the-discharge-day/)
    to reduce delays for patients and optimize bed usage.

-   [Identifying future bed demand post-surgery](https://web.archive.org/web/20220716034049/https://www.hospiq.com/blog/knowing-future-bed-demand-with-a-surgical-placement-forecaster/).

-   [Predicting Discharge Barriers to Optimize Patient Flow](https://web.archive.org/web/20230124154406/https://www.hospiq.com/blog/prioritizing-and-processing-discharges-to-better-manage-patient-flow/).

-   Predicting which [Operating Room reservation blocks](https://web.archive.org/web/20220902151438/https://www.hospiq.com/solutions/perioperative/)
    are most likely to go unused.

-   The [OM1 Medical Burden Index (OMBIÂ®)](https://www.om1.com/aipredictivemedicine/ombi/)
    that measures the combined medical burden of an individual or a patient population.
    It is a 1-1000 score of patient level comorbidity
    that is highly predictive of future resource usage and mortality.

-   [AI Sales Forecasting](https://www.insightsquared.com/revenue-intelligence-platform/sales-forecasting/).

-   [Characterizing user behavior and information propagation on a social multimedia network](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMEW.2013.6618395).
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

-   Establishing up-to-date, accurate, and comprehensive Space Situation Awareness in the
    [Activity Learning and Inferencing for Space Situational Awareness](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/824285)
    and
    [Rapid Identification of Space Objects using Multisensor Signatures](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/666352)
    programs.

-   Defending against cutting-edge cyber attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats in the
    [Context Aware Inference for Advanced Persistent Threat](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/873315)
    and
    [Context Aware Inference for Navy Cyber Situation Awareness (NCSA)](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/685198)
    programs.

    (SMISC) program.
