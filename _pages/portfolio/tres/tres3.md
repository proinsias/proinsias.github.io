## TrES-3 and the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey

The Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey ([TrES](https://proinsias.github.io/portfolio/tres.html))
was a network of telescopes, [Sleuth](https://proinsias.github.io/portfolio/tres/sleuth.html),
PSST and STARE, that was used to search the skies for gas giants orbiting other stars
that occasionally cross the disk of the stars.
We were pleased to [announce](https://www.doi.org/10.1086/519793) the discovery of our third planet, TrES-3
([original webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20080623114321/http://solas.dnsalias.org:8080/~ftod/tres/tres3.html)).
