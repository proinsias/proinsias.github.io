My initial foray into astronomy research centered on the study of compact objects, in particular black holes.

Working with [Dr. Paul Callanan](https://research.ucc.ie/profiles/D006/paulc) of the [Physics](http://physics.ucc.ie/)
Department of the [National University of Ireland, Cork](http://www.ucc.ie/),
I used the first high signal-to-noise _K_-band spectrum of a black hole
transient system
([GRO J1655-40](https://simbad.harvard.edu/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=gro+j1655-40&submit=SIMBAD+search)
) to constrain the contribution of the accretion disk in this system to the overall luminosity.
I modelled this soft X-ray transient using the _Eclipsing Light Curve (ELC)_
code of [Jerome A. Orosz](http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/faculty/orosz/).
Knowing the disk contribution, I was able to determine the mass of the black hole in this binary from
the model binary inclination.

This work evolved into my Masters thesis in Astrophysics, entitled
[Infrared Observations of GRO J1655-40: Constraints on the Black Hole Mass](https://github.com/proinsias/infrared-observations).
I later gave a [presentation](/assets/pdf/Ge132Presentation.pdf) on this work.
