TrES
([original web page](https://web.archive.org/web/20080620002210/http://solas.dnsalias.org:8080/~ftod//tres/tres.html)),
the Transatlantic Exoplanet Survey, was a network of three small-aperture telescopes (pictured above)
searching the sky for transiting planets.
The network consisted of
[Sleuth](https://proinsias.github.io/portfolio/tres/sleuth.html)
([Palomar Observatory](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/homepage.html),
Southern California), the [PSST](https://web.archive.org/web/20060912132008/http://www.lowell.edu/Research/PSST.html)
([Lowell Observatory](https://www.lowell.edu/), Northern Arizona) and
[STARE](https://www.hao.ucar.edu/research/stare/stare.html)
([Observatorio del Teide](https://web.archive.org/web/20190903220416/http://www.iac.es/eno.php?op1=3),
Canary Islands, Spain).

Our method of detection relied on the edge-on alignment of the
extrasolar system. If a planetary system is oriented so that Earth
lies near the plane of the planet's orbit, then once per orbit the
planet passes between its star and the Earth, causing a transit. This
orientation is more likely for planets orbiting close to their parent
star. During a transit, the planet blocks some of the light from the
star, causing the star to appear dimmer. For Jupiter-sized planets
transiting Sun-sized stars, the expected dimming of the star's light
will be about 1%, and the duration of the transit should be a few
hours.

To look for such a transit, the TrES telescopes took timed exposures
of the same field-of-view all night for as many nights as the field is
favorably positioned (usually around 2 months). When an observing
campaign was completed for a particular field, the multitude of data
was run through software which, after correcting for many sources of
distortion and noise, produced light curves for thousands of stars in
the field. Other software was run to analyze the processed data for
variable stars and transit candidates. It took two or more transits
(or cycles in a variable star) to discern the period of the orbit (or
the variability).

The TrES method favored giant planets orbiting sun-like stars
in close orbits. The results of successful radial-velocity planetary
searches showed that planetary systems of this type could be quite
common.

# Sleuth: The Palomar Planet Finder

More details on Sleuth, the telescope I used for my PhD discovery of three exoplanets,
can be found on the [Sleuth](https://proinsias.github.io/portfolio/tres/sleuth.html) main page.

Additional telescopic support at Palomar Observatory was provided by:

-   [Snoop](https://proinsias.github.io/portfolio/tres/snoop.html): our Palomar All-Sky Surveillance Camera
-   [Sherlock](https://proinsias.github.io/portfolio/tres/sherlock.html): our transit-contaminant detector

A nice [summary](https://web.archive.org/web/20160728221235/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20051102/news_lz1c02palomar.html)
of the Palomar trio of telescopes was written up by the San Diego Union Tribune.
