TrES, the Transatlantic Exoplanet Survey, is a network of three small-aperture telescopes (pictured above) searching the sky for transiting planets. The network consists of Sleuth ([Palomar Observatory](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/homepage.html), Southern California), the [PSST](https://web.archive.org/web/20060912132008/http://www.lowell.edu/Research/PSST.html) ([Lowell Observatory](https://www.lowell.edu/), Northern Arizona) and [STARE](https://www.hao.ucar.edu/research/stare/stare.html) ([Observatorio del Teide](https://web.archive.org/web/20190903220416/http://www.iac.es/eno.php?op1=3), Canary Islands, Spain).

Our method of detection relies on the edge-on alignment of the
extrasolar system. If a planetary system is oriented so that Earth
lies near the plane of the planet's orbit, then once per orbit the
planet passes between its star and the Earth, causing a transit. This
orientation is more likely for planets orbiting close to their parent
star. During a transit, the planet blocks some of the light from the
star, causing the star to appear dimmer. For Jupiter-sized planets
transiting Sun-sized stars, the expected dimming of the star's light
will be about 1%, and the duration of the transit should be a few
hours.

To look for such a transit, the TrES telescopes takes timed exposures
of the same field-of-view all night for as many nights as the field is
favorably positioned (usually around 2 months). When an observing
campaign is completed for a particular field, the multitude of data
are run through software which, after correcting for many sources of
distortion and noise, produces light curves for thousands of stars in
the field. Other software is run to analyze the processed data for
variable stars and transit candidates. It takes two or more transits
(or cycles in a variable star) to discern the period of the orbit (or
the variability).

The TrES method therefore favors giant planets orbiting sun-like stars
in close orbits. The results of successful radial-velocity planetary
searches have shown that planetary systems of this type could be quite
common.
